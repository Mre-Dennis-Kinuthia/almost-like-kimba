## Introduction
Almost Like Kimba's Code Plagiarism Detector is an advanced tool designed to identify and analyze potential code plagiarism within submitted code snippets. This README provides comprehensive information on features, installation, implementation, and usage of the detector.

## Features
- **Tokenization of Source Code:**
  - Breaks down source code into smaller units (tokens) for efficient analysis.

- **Code Representation Creation:**
  - Converts tokenized code into a representation suitable for comparison.

- **Similarity Measures:**
  - Implements various similarity measures, including cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity.

- **Adjustable Similarity Threshold:**
  - Users can set a threshold to customize the sensitivity of plagiarism detection.

- **Database Storage:**
  - Stores representations of known code snippets for efficient and quick retrieval.

- **Efficient Code Comparison:**
  - Compares new code against the database using optimized algorithms.

- **Optional User Interface:**
  - Provides a user-friendly interface for easy plagiarism checking.
